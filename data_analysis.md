# Group 6 - Project 1

## Data Cleaning
	To understand our data, some quick visualizations were run. Sophie Geister-Jones created visuals of the dataset based on gender, age, blood pressure, and sleep disorder diagnosis. We noticed that there seemed to be a larger amount of study participants that have hypertensive blood pressure than would be expected.
	Bob Erickson did the majority of cleaning the data when we were all first exploring it. He split the blood pressure into two columns that were labeled as Systolic and Diastolic. That allowed Sophie Geister-Jones to create a qualitative column for blood pressure that labeled the data as “low,” “normal,” “elevated,” or “hypertensive.” Additionally, Erickson also cleaned up the Sleep Disorder column by replacing “NaN” values with “No Diagnosis”.

## Analysis Questions
	The Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset uploaded on Kaggle.com by Laksika Tharmalingam (2023) contained data on 374 individuals’ gender, age, sleep duration and quality, stress level, physical activity level, blood pressure, and BMI standing. After examining the raw data, we had three questions we wished to investigate: (1) How does sleep relate individually to level of fitness during the day? (2) How does sleep relate to general stress levels? (3) Does gender and age affect the variables in a statistically significant way?
  We hypothesized that the best way to search for any potential relationships was to analyze the relationship between sleep and fitness, sleep and stress, and stress and fitness and to see if any one relationship had a stronger correlation than others.
