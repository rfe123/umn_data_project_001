### Sleep and Physical Activity

### Sleep and Stress Levels

### Affect of Age
Age vs. Sleep Quality:
• For male sleep quality, the R-squared value is 0.0771, suggesting that approximately 7.71% of the variability in male sleep quality can be explained by age.
• The R-squared value for female sleep quality is 0.2066, indicating that around 20.66% of the variance in female sleep quality is accounted for by age.
• When considering both genders, the overall R-squared is 0.2244, meaning that the model explains approximately 22.44% of the variance in sleep quality based on age.

These findings indicate that age has some association with sleep quality, yet a significant portion of the variability remains unexplained. The R-squared values are relatively low, indicating that age alone may not be a strong predictor of sleep quality, and it’s helpful to explore other variables influencing sleep quality.


T-test results:
T-statistic: -5.859317976055214
P-value: 1.078122839334259e-08 
The negative T-statistic means that, on average, females have better sleep quality than males. The small P-value strongly supports this, indicating a significant difference in sleep quality between males and females. Therefore, it seems like females generally sleep better than males.
