### Current Leading Questions
How does sleep relate individually to level of fitness during the day? 
How does sleep relate to general mood/stress levels throughout the day? 
Does gender affect the variables in any particular way? Does age? 
Which variable (sleep, mood, fitness) has the strongest pull on the other variables?

### Questions to Ask Throughout Project
What relationship are we investigating? How is the best way to visualize that relationship?
What are important statistics for this?
How to consistently measure mood? Is it worthwhile to this task?
What does this mean for our particular slice of Question Pie, and what does it mean for the larger, whole Question Pie?

### Questions for Our Conclusions
Was there a way to consistently measure mood? Is that mostly subjective?
What are potential factors that we did not include in our analysis that may have some sway over this data? (Sleep disorders, hydration, general nutritional value of food/number of meals they’re eating/mental illness/living situations/life in general) 
Was our data pulling from some populations more than others? (gender, age, type of job)

## Healthcare
Exploratory data analysis is used by many individuals within the healthcare field, including clinical data analysts, pharmaceutical testers, healthcare-economics researchers, senior policy analysts, compliance operations analysts, and public health informatics scientists.

Exploratory data analysis is important for understanding the following healthcare considerations:
- Predicting and diagnosing illnesses
- Improving patient safety
- Reducing time to diagnosis
- Increasing our understanding of disease risks and causes
- Developing stronger prevention strategies

## Project Example

Personal Fitness Analyst: Research whether working out helps a person become more active overall. Use data collected by the [Samsung Health application](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aroojanwarkhan/fitness-data-trends) to uncover relevant trends. What do the results tell you about individuals using this app? Have their lifestyles become more active? Less? Remained the same?
